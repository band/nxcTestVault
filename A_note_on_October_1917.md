# A note on October 1917

DeplorableBristolian (@deplorabristol): How did that work out for them? https://twitter.com/socialist_app/status/1589577387116990464

Phillip Hodson (@philliphodson): @deplorabristol The French Revolution destroyed civil society & reinforced French imperialism.  The Russian Revolution destroyed world security & reinforced Russian imperialism - ultimately resulting in Putin’s fascism.  I’d rather venerate Magna Carta.

Cate Sedgwick (@CateMS111): @philliphodson @deplorabristol It's supposed to be about power for workers but it never is ultimately. I see it as just another tool used by powerful entities to knock down other powerful entities and rule. A cycle throughout history. They sacrifice civilian lives instead of just fighting each other.
