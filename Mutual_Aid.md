# Mutual Aid

@zellieimani: Mutual aid is a principle, not one particular act.

Capitalist ideology teaches us that we can attain greater success, gauged as “freedom” & stability, through being individualistic, competitive & exploitative.

Mutual aid challenges this ideology. And that’s why it’s a threat.
