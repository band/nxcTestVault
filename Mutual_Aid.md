# Mutual Aid

@zellieimani: Mutual aid is a principle, not one particular act.

Capitalist ideology teaches us that we can attain greater success, gauged as “freedom” and stability, through being individualistic, competitive, and exploitative.

Mutual aid challenges this ideology. And that is why it is a threat.
