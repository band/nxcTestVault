# README

This is a laboratory repo for testing Massive Wiki publishing explorations.

It is intended to be an experimental workbench and part-time Obsidian
vault. We aim, and try, to keep the lab tidy, but it will be messy. Items found
in the repository now may not be there tomorrow (or even five minutes
from now).
