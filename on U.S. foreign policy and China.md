“Competition with China has begun to consume U.S. foreign policy,” Jessica Chen Weiss writes [in a new essay](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/china-trap-us-foreign-policy-zero-sum-competition). U.S. policymakers “are becoming so focused on countering China that they risk losing sight of the affirmative interests and values that should underpin U.S. strategy.”  

Washington’s “well-warranted alarm” regarding Beijing’s authoritarian streak risks “morphing into a reflexive fear that could reshape American policy and society in counterproductive and ultimately harmful ways,” argues Weiss. “The current course will not just bring indefinite deterioration of the U.S.-Chinese relationship and a growing danger of catastrophic conflict; it also threatens to undermine the sustainability of American leadership in the world and the vitality of American society and democracy at home.”
